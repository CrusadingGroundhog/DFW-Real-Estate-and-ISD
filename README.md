  <p align="center"> Where to go for the perfect house for your family and the perfect school for your children. </p>

## Premise
We are working for a real estate company in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex that wishes to specialise in sellings homes to families coming into the area. 

We have created  a Dashboard where parents/potential house buyers can easily click through the public school districts in the four main DFW Counties to see what is the best bang for their buck they can get school district wise. 

## Data

We cleaned up the data from multiple sources, the previously mentioned TEA and Appraisal Districts for the counties. We combined the data into a single .csv file.

**Data Included**
| Years  | Type of Data  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| N/A |  County Name  |
| N/A | School District Name  |
| 2019 | Median Income |
|2016-20 |Total Property Values per ISD |
|2016-20 |Median Property Values per ISD | 
|2016-20 |Taxes Due per ISD |
|2016-20 |Annual Taxes Due |
|2018/19 | District Academic Ratings |

**Potential Data Issues** 

* School District Ratings: Only two years of Data due to a change in Ratings to A-F from a pass-fail in previous years and a lack of data due to the strange 2020 Covid school year. 
   

Finalized Data: [School District Rankings & Property Tax](DFW_RE.csv)
