## Housing and Schooling: What you need to know about Housing Prices, Taxes, and School District Performance

The scenario behind this project is that we are working for a real estate company in the DFW Metroplex. We are interested in making sure that parents have the best information available when making their choice on to live.  
We have created  a Dashboard where parents/potential house buyers can easily click through the public school districts in the four main DFW Counties to see what is the best bang for their buck they can get school district wise.  To do this we are pulling data from the Texas Education Agency and the Appraisal Districts for the four counties (Collin, Dallas, Denton, Tarrant)

## Data

We cleaned up the data from multiple sources, the previously mentioned TEA and Appraisal Districts for the counties. We combined the data into a single .csv file.

The Data Included
* District/County Names
* Median Income (2019)
* Total Property Values per ISD (2016-2020)
* Average Property Values per ISD (2016-2020)
* Taxes Due per ISD (2016-2020)
* Annual Taxes Due (2016-2020)
* District Ratings (2018-2019)

One quirk of the COVID-19 Pandemic is that we did not have school ratings for 2020, that combined with the change in 2018 from the previous school ranking on a Pass/Fail type grading system meant that we only two years of data to work with. We believe this to be adequate as school districts will not have major variance over such a short amount of time and any data from the COVID-19 year of remote school might toss a wrench in things.
