## Premise
We are working for a real estate company in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex that wishes to specialise in sellings homes to families coming into the area. 

We have created  a Dashboard where parents/potential house buyers can easily click through the public school districts in the four main DFW Counties to see what is the best bang for their buck they can get school district wise. 

## Data

We cleaned up the data from multiple sources, the previously mentioned TEA and Appraisal Districts for the counties. We combined the data into a single .csv file.

The Data Included
* District/County Names
* Median Income (2019)
* Total Property Values per ISD (2016-2020)
* Average Property Values per ISD (2016-2020)
* Taxes Due per ISD (2016-2020)
* Annual Taxes Due (2016-2020)
* District Ratings (2018-2019)

One quirk of the COVID-19 Pandemic is that we did not have school ratings for 2020, that combined with the change in 2018 from the previous school ranking on a Pass/Fail type grading system meant that we only two years of data to work with. We believe this to be adequate as school districts will not have major variance over such a short amount of time and any data from the COVID-19 year of remote school might toss a wrench in things.    

Finalized Data: [School District Rankings & Property Tax](DFW_RE.csv)
